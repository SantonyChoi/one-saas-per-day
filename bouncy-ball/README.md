# Three.js Bouncy Ball

A simple 3D simulation of a bouncing ball created with Three.js.

## Features

- 3D ball that bounces with realistic physics
- Shadow casting for improved visual effects
- Simple animation with gravity and damping
- Responsive design that adapts to window size
- The ball resets after it stops bouncing

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser
   - You can use a local server for better performance:
     - `npm install -g http-server` 
     - Run `http-server` in the project directory
     - Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser

## Technologies Used

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Vanilla JavaScript for animation and physics
- HTML5 and CSS3 for structure and styling

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `js/app.js` - JavaScript code for the 3D scene and animation
- No build tools or dependencies required - just open and run!

## Controls

This simulation runs automatically with no user controls.
After the ball stops bouncing, it will reset to its initial position after a short delay.
